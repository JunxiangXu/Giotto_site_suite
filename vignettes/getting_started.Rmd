Giotto provides a lot of analyses, visualizations and other options to facilitate your spatial dataset analysis.
We are working on providing easy-to-understand examples or tutorials, but if anything is not clear or if there is something you would like to see in particular, then do not hesitate to contact [us](https://github.com/RubD/Giotto/issues).

## Installation

You can install Giotto Suite on any platform in 2 easy steps:

#### Step 1: install Giotto Suite
``` r
library(remotes)
remotes::install_github("RubD/Giotto@suite") 
```

#### Step 2: install the Giotto python environment
The python environment only needs to be installed once.

``` r
library(Giotto)
installGiottoEnvironment()
```

This command only needs to be run once and then Giotto will automatically detect the environment in the future.
